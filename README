# Windows 95 Solitaire - The Platformer

## Info

The game is a platformer with two modes: **cooperative** and **competitive**.
In **cooperative** the goal is to work together, and in **competitive** it is
a race to gain the most points. In both modes, you play as a playing card.
You can walk left with `a`, right with `d`, and jump with `w`. You can
walk on the gray colored blocks, and die when you either fall too far
below all of the blocks or when you touch the gray spikes. After dying,
a short animation will play, and your player will be gone for 5 seconds.
After this time is up, you will respawn at the start of the level.
You can jump while standing on a block or while standing on another player.
You cannot move through other players.

The game is multiplayer - all other players will be represented as jokers to
you. The game is about collecting other playing cards - you can collect
a card if and only iff it is one rank below you and it is opposite in color
to you. I.e. if you are a black king you can only collect a red queen, and
to collect a red queen you must be a black king.
The ranks go `King` - `Queen` - `Jack` - `10` - `9` - `8` - `7` - `6` - `5` - 
`4` - `3` - `2` - `Ace`. At the start of the game, all players are a King.
All players are always the same rank and color, meaning they can all always
collect the same cards.

The game ends in either mode once a player has collected an Ace. If the
game is in **cooperative** mode, then all players currently in the game
win. If the game is in **competitive** mode, the game checks which player
has collected the most cards. The player that has collected the most is the
sole winner. In the case of a tie, all players who tied for first place win.
Everyone else loses. After a game ends, there will be a brief celebration
phase followed by a reset.
